### About myself:

I’m a third-year student of KIT. The fourth semester has already finished and it was really interesting to create websites and desktop apps but I’d like to get the knowledge that will be enough for a company so I’ve decided to take a course in RS School.

### Skills:

* HTML5, CSS3
* JavaScript (Basics)
* C# (WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET Core MVC)
* MS SQL
* Git, GitHub
* Figma
* VS Code, Visual Studio

### Code Example:

```

function fakeBin(x){
  let result = '';
  
  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    if (x[i] < 5) {
      result += x[i].replace(x[i], '0');
    } else {
      result += x[i].replace(x[i], '1');
    }
  }
  
  return result;
}

```
